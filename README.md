# First_time_join_2020

This is a test by RENreap.

I have started leaning programming this year, mainly Python. I work as full time in a company where I do not use programming, so I learn it by myself.
I stopped joining at Cyber Univercity on Jan. 2021. After that I have been leaning at Coursera since Feb 2021.
If I know more about Python, I hope I can write code here in Github.
