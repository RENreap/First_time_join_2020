# First_time_join_2020
This is a test by RENreap
I have started leaning programming this year, mainly Python. I work as full time in a company where I do not use programming, so I learn it by myself.
It goes very slowly since I have to combine my work and studies (at Cyber University)
If I know more about Python, I hope I can write code here in Github.
